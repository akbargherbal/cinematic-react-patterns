    "core": "The structural design of the Titanic, particularly its watertight bulkheads, serves as a metaphor for React Error Boundaries. Just as bulkheads are designed to contain flooding and prevent a single breach from sinking the entire ship, Error Boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree, log them, and display a fallback UI, preventing an error in one part of the UI from crashing the entire application.",
