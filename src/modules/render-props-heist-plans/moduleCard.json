    "core": "The intricate heist planning in 'Ocean's Eleven', where diverse specialists need access to the same live security data but for different, specific tasks, serves as a metaphor for the Render Props pattern in React. The module illustrates how a central component can manage complex state and logic (like the Bellagio's security system) and 'render' its children by passing this live data as a function prop, allowing specialized child components to consume and display this data in highly flexible and reusable ways without duplicating logic.",

    "narrativeArc": "The module presents Danny Ocean's 'dilemma' of sharing live security data among specialists. It then exposes the 'brittle blueprints' anti-pattern (duplicated state logic) that leads to sync errors. The 'blank card' (render prop) is introduced as the solution, embodying inversion of control. A comparison of 'two plans' demonstrates the robustness of render props over brittle approaches, culminating in the 'fountain' where shared, adaptable logic enables a successful heist, showcasing the power of render props for flexible component reuse."
