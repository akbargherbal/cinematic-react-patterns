He then encounters the Party's 'clear' terminal (controlled input) where every keystroke is intercepted and validated, forcing conformity to a single truth. This narrative arc demonstrates the problems of uncontrolled components and the benefits of controlled components for data consistency, validation, and a seamless user experience."
