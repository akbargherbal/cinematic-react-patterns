    "core": "The PreCrime system from 'Minority Report', where precognitive mutants (PreCogs) foresee future crimes (state changes) and their visions are processed to maintain a stable timeline and prevent chaos, serves as a metaphor for React's `useReducer` hook. The module illustrates how `useReducer` centralizes complex state logic (like the PreCrime system) into a single, predictable function, ensuring that multiple, interdependent state updates (interconnected crime visions) are handled atomically and coherently, leading to a more stable and manageable application state than scattered `useState` calls.",

It then exposes the 'chaos of intersecting futures' (problems with multiple `useState` hooks for complex state). The 'Reducer Protocol' (useReducer) is introduced as the solution, centralizing state logic. 'Two Timelines' compares the `useState` anti-pattern with the `useReducer` solution, highlighting its benefits. The module culminates in 'The Elegance of Dispatch', demonstrating how `useReducer` provides a predictable, maintainable way to manage complex application state."
