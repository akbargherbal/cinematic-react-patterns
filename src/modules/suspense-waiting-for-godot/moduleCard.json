  "metaphor": {
    "core": "The play 'Waiting for Godot', where two tramps fill time with absurd actions while perpetually anticipating the arrival of an unseen entity, serves as a metaphor for React Suspense. The module illustrates how Suspense provides a declarative way to handle asynchronous operations and loading states: the 'empty road' and the tramps' actions represent the fallback UI, while the 'eventual arrival of Godot' signifies the completion of a data fetch or code load. This pattern allows components to 'suspend' rendering until data is ready, providing a smoother user experience than manual, imperative loading indicators.",

    "narrativeArc": "The module sets the scene with the 'empty road' (fallback UI) and the perpetual 'waiting for Godot' (pending asynchronous state). It then demonstrates the 'tyranny of the horizon' (imperative loading anti-pattern) with manual polling and its associated problems (fragmented UI, leaks). The 'Suspense curtain' is introduced as the declarative solution, followed by a 'two acts, two worlds' comparison of imperative vs. declarative approaches. The module concludes with 'the art of being', showcasing how Suspense simplifies async state management and improves user experience."
