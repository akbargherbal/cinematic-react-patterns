    "core": "The time loop experienced by Major William Cage in 'Edge of Tomorrow', where he relives the same battle repeatedly, serves as a metaphor for React's re-rendering process. The module demonstrates how `React.memo` (and `useMemo`/`useCallback`) allows components to 'skip' unnecessary re-renders when their props haven't changed, conserving computational 'energy' and 'execution time' by recognizing already-solved 'battlefields' and focusing resources only on new 'threats' (changed props).",

It starts with the 'relentless render' (default React re-rendering), exposes the inefficiency of the 'brute-force approach' (unoptimized components), introduces the 'recognition principle' (`React.memo`) as a solution, compares 'effort vs. memory' (cost of re-rendering vs. benefits of memoization), and culminates in a 'symphony of optimization' where `React.memo` is applied strategically across a component tree."
