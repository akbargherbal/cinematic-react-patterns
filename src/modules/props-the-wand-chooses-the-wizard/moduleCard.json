Just as a wand's immutable properties (wood, core, length) define its nature and are determined by its maker (parent component) and cannot be changed by the wizard (child component), React props are read-only values passed from parent to child components, defining their configuration and behavior in a one-way data flow.",

It then depicts Ron's frustrated attempt to 'mutate' his hand-me-down wand's core, illustrating the immutability of props. This is contrasted with Neville's successful acquisition of a new wand with different properties (parent providing new props). A side-by-side comparison solidifies the lesson, culminating in the 'Great Hall of Wands' showing how diverse component instances are created through varied props."
