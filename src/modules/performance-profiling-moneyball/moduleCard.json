    "core": "The data-driven approach of the Oakland A's in 'Moneyball', where undervalued players are identified through statistical analysis instead of 'gut feel' and aesthetics, serves as a metaphor for performance profiling in React. The module illustrates how using React's Profiler tools (like `React.Profiler`) to collect concrete data about component render times and frequencies allows developers to identify actual performance bottlenecks and optimize effectively, rather than wasting effort on components that merely 'look' complex.",

It contrasts 'two ways of seeing' (scouts' aesthetic-based vs. profiler's data-based optimization) and culminates in a 'winning streak' (achieving smooth application performance through data-driven decisions), emphasizing the importance of profiling over intuition."
