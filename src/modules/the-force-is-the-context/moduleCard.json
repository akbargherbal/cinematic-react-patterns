The module illustrates how `useContext` allows components at any level of the component tree to 'tap into' a shared global state (the Force), enabling them to access and update common data without the need for prop drilling. It also explores the 'dark side' of context: overusing it for local state, leading to unnecessary re-renders and tight coupling.",

    "narrativeArc": "The module introduces the Force as a pervasive field (context). It then demonstrates the inefficiency and fragility of 'The Path of the Messenger' (prop drilling). Anya learns to 'Reach Out' (useContext) for direct access to shared data, avoiding the need for manual data passing. A comparison of 'the chain and the connection' highlights the benefits of context. Finally, 'The Dark Side of Dependence' explores the pitfalls of overusing context for local state, emphasizing a balanced approach to state management."
