    "core": "The meticulously crafted, yet ultimately fake, world of Seahaven Island in 'The Truman Show', controlled by Christof from a distant lunar studio, serves as a metaphor for React Server Components (RSC). The module illustrates how RSC allows developers (Christof) to render static or data-intensive parts of the UI (Seahaven's background, weather, news) entirely on the server (Lunar Control Room), sending minimal JavaScript to the client (Truman's world). Interactive elements (like Truman's car) remain Client Components, ensuring a fast, seamless user experience by offloading heavy rendering and data fetching from the client to the server.",

It then depicts the 'lagging prop department' (bloated client bundles) as the consequence of sending everything client-side. Christof's 'director's cut' (strategic use of RSC) is introduced as the solution. A comparison of 'two blueprints' highlights the performance difference, culminating in 'The View from the Moon', where a seamless user experience is achieved by moving heavy lifting to the server, underscoring the benefits of RSC."
