    "core": "The concept of 'inverted' time streams flowing alongside 'forward' time in 'Tenet', where actions and their consequences can be decoupled and experienced at different relative moments, serves as a metaphor for React's `useDeferredValue` hook. The module illustrates how `useDeferredValue` allows urgent UI updates (like user input in 'forward time') to proceed immediately, while a 'deferred' version of the state (like an 'inverted' time stream) is used for less urgent, potentially expensive rendering or computations (the 'consequence'), thereby preventing the slow computations from blocking the main thread and ensuring a responsive user experience.",

It then demonstrates the 'Ståls-12 Stutter' (UI blocking due to unoptimized expensive renders). 'Engaging the Turnstile' (using `useDeferredValue`) is presented as the solution to decouple urgent input from delayed expensive computations. A comparison of 'Two Sides of the Glass' highlights the benefits of responsiveness, culminating in 'What's Happened, Happened', illustrating how `useDeferredValue` helps orchestrate multiple time streams for a stable and responsive UI."
