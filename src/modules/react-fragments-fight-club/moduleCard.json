    "core": "The core concept of 'Fight Club'—two distinct personalities coexisting within a single body, and the philosophical struggle with identity and control—serves as a metaphor for React Fragments. A React component must return a single root element, yet often needs to render multiple sibling elements. Fragments (`<>...</>`) allow these elements to be grouped without introducing an unnecessary wrapper DOM node, thereby maintaining a clean and semantically correct UI structure, akin to two personalities existing without a 'third man' container.",

It then introduces the problematic 'Third Man' (wrapper `div`), demonstrating how it breaks layouts. The revelation that 'the wrapper was a lie' leads to Fragments as the elegant solution. A clear comparison of 'one box vs. no box' solidifies the understanding, culminating in a 'clean structure' enabled by Fragments."
