JSX is presented as the human-readable, declarative language (the 'what') for describing UI in React, which is then compiled into the machine-level `React.createElement` calls (the 'how') that React actually executes. This mirrors how Neo learns to 'see' the Matrix's code to understand and control its reality.",

'Two Maps, One Destination' compares JSX and its compiled output, and finally, Neo's 'I Know JSX' moment signifies mastery, seeing both the UI and the underlying code."
