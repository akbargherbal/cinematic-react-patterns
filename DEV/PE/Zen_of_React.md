# Zen Rules of React - Ordered by Criticality
1. Hooks should follow their rules, not bend them.
2. Side effects belong in effects, not in render.
3. Trust React's rendering, but verify your dependencies.
4. Keys aren't optional—they're essential.
5. Props down, events up.
6. Composition over inheritance, always.
7. Explicit state changes beat implicit mutations.
8. Components should do one thing well.
9. Declarative is better than imperative.
10. A component that's easy to test is easy to understand.
11. If your component needs everything, it probably does too much.
12. Simple components are better than clever ones.
13. When logic repeats, extract it.
14. Beautiful UIs emerge from components that know their place.
15. Readability counts, even in JSX.
16. Lift state up when sharing; keep it local when not.
17. Premature optimization obscures, but sluggish UX frustrates.
18. If the props list grows too long, reconsider the component.
19. In the face of complexity, add a layer of abstraction—but just one.
20. But working code beats perfect architecture.
