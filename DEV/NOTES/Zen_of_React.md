# The Zen of React
Here's my take on guiding principles for React developers, inspired by the style and spirit of The Zen of Python:
**Components should do one thing well.**
**Composition over inheritance, always.**
**Props down, events up.**
**Declarative is better than imperative.**
**Explicit state changes beat implicit mutations.**
**If your component needs everything, it probably does too much.**
**Lift state up when sharing; keep it local when not.**
**Side effects belong in effects, not in render.**
**Keys aren't optional—they're essential.**
**A component that's easy to test is easy to understand.**
**Readability counts, even in JSX.**
**Simple components are better than clever ones.**
**But working code beats perfect architecture.**
**Hooks should follow their rules, not bend them.**
**When logic repeats, extract it.**
**Trust React's rendering, but verify your dependencies.**
**Premature optimization obscures, but sluggish UX frustrates.**
**In the face of complexity, add a layer of abstraction—but just one.**
**If the props list grows too long, reconsider the component.**
**Beautiful UIs emerge from components that know their place.**
